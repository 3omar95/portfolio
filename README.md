# 👋 Omar Gamal Elsherbiny | Data Scientist 

Welcome to my **Data Science & AI Portfolio**   

I’m a **Data Scientist** with a distinction-level MSc and hands-on experience delivering **machine learning, AI, and analytics solutions** across telecom, travel, real estate, and marketing.  
I specialize in building **end-to-end AI systems** that cover data engineering, model development, deployment, and visualization. My work focuses on measurable business impact, improving decision-making, optimizing user experience, and driving value.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. End-to-End Traffic Forecasting System  
A full pipeline combining **Computer Vision (YOLOv8 + BYTETrack)**, **Traffic Volume Forecasting (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, ConvLSTM)**, and **Web Deployment (Dash/Plotly)**.  
- *Goal*: Detect and count vehicles in real time and forecast next-hour traffic flow.  
- *Key Results*: XGBoost with PCA achieved the best performance with R² ≈ 0.97.  
- *Features*: Interactive dashboard, lane-based vehicle counting, time-series forecasting.

### 2. Smart Data Exploration Agent  
An **AI-driven data exploration system** that empowers both **data analysts** and **non-technical users** to query databases using natural language instead of SQL.  
- *Goal*: Accelerate data analysis workflows and enable intuitive database exploration without writing SQL code.  
- *Core Components*: Semantic schema mapping, intelligent SQL generation, and a self-correcting feedback loop.  
- *Tech Stack*: OpenAI, Claude, Hugging Face Models, Sentence-Transformers, SQLite, Streamlit, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- *Key Results*: Improved query success rate through automatic corrections and achieved an average **validation score of 7.4 / 10** (measured by the LLM-as-a-Judge), indicating strong SQL generation reliability.  
- *Key Features*:  
  - Automatic extraction of database schema (tables, columns, types)  
  - Semantic similarity mapping between user intent and relevant table fields  
  - LLM-based SQL generation with automated error handling and correction  
  - Interactive Streamlit interface for visualizing query results (bar and line charts)
