## 🚀 Featured Projects

### End-to-End Traffic Forecasting System  
A full pipeline combining **Computer Vision (YOLOv8 + BYTETrack)**, **Traffic Volume Forecasting (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, ConvLSTM)**, and **Web Deployment (Dash/Plotly)**.  
- *Goal*: Detect and count vehicles in real time and forecast next-hour traffic flow.  
- *Key Results*: XGBoost with PCA achieved the best performance with R² ≈ 0.97.  
- *Features*: Interactive dashboard, lane-based vehicle counting, time-series forecasting.
